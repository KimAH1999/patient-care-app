# patient-care-app

## Description

We built this application as a team project. In the process of building this application, we learned a lot about working together and how to propertly plan for deadline. This project that we planned together from scratch has been very helpful.

## Usage

User Story: As a healthcare practitioner (i.e. nurse, PA, doctor), I see multiple patients on a day-to-day basis. This means I have numerous patient charts to keep track of. I want an application that allows me to store patient data and retrieve the information based on the name and ID of the patient that I am seeing on a given day.

Future Plans to make this website better is under construction, but we planned to make the website better by adding a symptoom checker and for the patient to be able to send any new symptoms to the provider via message.
